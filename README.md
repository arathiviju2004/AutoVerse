### Project Description
AutoVerse is a cutting-edge digital platform designed to modernize the auto-rickshaw industry. By providing seamless fare calculation, real-time GPS tracking, and enhanced driver-customer interactions, AutoVerse brings transparency, convenience, and safety to every ride. The platform empowers drivers with features like earning summaries and customer feedback while offering riders a smarter, safer, and more efficient travel experience.

### The Problem Statement
Auto-rickshaw passengers often face the unfair challenge of being charged higher fares due to a lack of transparency, with drivers sometimes quoting incorrect or inflated fares. Additionally, the absence of a tracking system in existing rickshaws leaves customers vulnerable during unpredicted emergencies, without any means of locating or ensuring their safety.

### The Solution
AutoVerse transforms the rickshaw experience into something seamless, safe, and completely transparent. When a passenger hops into a rickshaw, they simply scan a QR code to start their journey. As soon as they scan, GPS tracks the ride, linking the journey to the vehicle number and pulling up the driverâ€™s details. Passengers can choose to share their live location throughout the ride for added security. And if something unexpected happens, the passenger can instantly send an emergency alert via SMS to a contact at the press of a button.

At the end of the ride, the fare is displayed clearly, and passengers can leave feedback to rate the driver. Drivers, on the other hand, have their own dashboard, where they can view their earnings summary â€” automatically calculated from each ride â€” and check customer feedback. Itâ€™s a perfect blend of convenience, safety, and transparency, making every ride smoother for both drivers and passengers.
